# Bike-sharing-Demand-Forecasting-using-Linear-Regression
### Problem Statement:
A bike-sharing system offers short-term bike rentals, either for a fee or free of charge. Users can access bikes from docks equipped with payment systems, and return them to any dock within the same network.

The US bike-sharing provider, BoomBikes, has faced substantial revenue declines due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To navigate this challenging market, the company seeks to develop a strategic plan to boost revenue once the lockdowns end and the economy recovers.

BoomBikes aims to gauge the post-quarantine demand for shared bikes in response to the pandemic and emerge as a prominent service provider, positioning for significant profitability.

They have engaged a consulting firm to discern the factors influencing shared bike demand, specifically in the American market. The company aims to answer two key questions:

1. Identify significant variables for predicting shared bike demand.
2. Assess the effectiveness of these variables in describing bike demand.

Using data from meteorological surveys and lifestyle factors, the service provider has compiled a substantial dataset on daily bike demand across the American market.

### Business Goal:
The task is to construct a model for predicting shared bike demand using available independent variables. This model will aid management in understanding how demand varies with different features. It will enable the adjustment of business strategies to align with demand levels and customer expectations. Additionally, the model will serve as a valuable tool for comprehending the demand dynamics of a new market.
